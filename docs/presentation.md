# Individual Project Sprint 1 Retrospective
## Cleyton Shelton

# Purpose

- A lot of time is spent on making fault routines on new projects
- Wanted a way to speed up this process for the engineers and allow them to work on the harder parts of the projects

## Goals Met for Sprint 1

- Can make normal text that can be pasted into Studio 5000
- Got the window set up and UI
- Got the main types of faults

## Numbers (Total)

**Total LoC**: 430
**Number of features completed**: 3
**Number of requirements completed**: 3
**Burndown rate**: 100%

## What Went Wrong

- Getting the fault types to print properly and have all the correct bits was tough
- Didnt spend much time on this project
- When you paste the text, you have to manually create each tag

- Got an importable file to work (sprint 2)
